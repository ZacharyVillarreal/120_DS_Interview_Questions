    "2. What could be some issues if the distribution of the test data is significantly different than the distribution of the training data.\n",
    "    * The model will have high training accuracy but have a low test accuracy. Without knowing a bunch of information about the dataa, it is hard to understand which dataset represents the population data and the generalizability of the algorithm is hard to measure. This should be mitigated by repeated splitting of train vs. test dataset (cross-validation).\n",
    "        * If the train and test data has a different distribution, the classifier would likely overfit to the train data.\n",
    "        * This issue can be overcome by using a more general learning method.\n",
    "        * This can occur when:\n",
    "            * P(y|x) are the same but P(x) are different. (covariance shift)\n",

    "    * MSE is more strict to having outliers. While, MAE is more robust in that sense, but is harder to fit the model for because it cannot be numerically optimized. So, when there is less variability in the model and the model is computationally easy to fit, we should use MAE, and if that's not the case, we should use MSE.\n",
